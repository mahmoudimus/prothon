# This file and any other files contained in 
# the same directory as prothon.exe that end in .pth,
# are read by prothon.exe, the prothon interpreter, when
# the interpreter starts running.

# These .pth files may contain blank lines, comment lines that
# start with #, lines that are valid directory paths, and prothon
# import statements.

# Directory paths are added to the list Sys.path.  Sys.path is used
# by prothon when searching for packages and modules to load.  It
# is searched in order through this list.

# Import commands are executed as they are encountered in the .pth
# file so make sure the needed path directories are specified first.

# this period adds this prothon home directory to Sys.path
.

# import commands would follow here
